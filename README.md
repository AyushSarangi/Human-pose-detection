# Human-pose-detection
This model is designed for pose estimation. Pose estimation involves identifying key points on a person's body in an image to determine their pose .
## model.pth
model.pth is a file containing pretrained weights which can be used in further training.
## finding the optimal hyperparams and use them in final training.
Run the Raytune file to obtain optimal hyperparameters and then use them in final notebook to perform training.
